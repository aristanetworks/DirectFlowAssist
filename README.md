## DirectFlow Assist for Firewalls

### Quick Overview
DirectFlow Assist (DFA) is an EOS extension that runs on an Arista switch to 
dynamically insert flow table entries via Arista's DirectFlow API, to offload or assist 
an attached in-line or out-of-band security platform such as a firewall. By providing 
integrated control over network forwarding to the firewall, DFA allows dynamic security 
policies to be applied in the network based on intelligence derived from best-of-breed 
security platforms.
